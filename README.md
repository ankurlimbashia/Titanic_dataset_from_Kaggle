## Titanic_dataset_from-Kaggle

This titanic_dataset from Kaggel is about the details of people(i.e. name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc) and whethe they survived or not.

So, I have built a model using RandomForestClassier and hypertuned it to predict the what sort of people were more likely to survive which gave me accuracy of around 78% on test data.
