## Titanic_dataset_from-Kaggle

https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview

This titanic_dataset from Kaggel is about the details of people(i.e. name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc) and whethe they survived or not.

So, I have built models using differnet techniques like RandomForestClassifier, XGBClassifier, LogisticRegression and using neural networks to predict the what sort of people were more likely to survive. I have built five models and for the final prediction I have taken the mean value of each prediciton made by all different classifiers and neural network which gave me accuracy of around 79% on test data.
